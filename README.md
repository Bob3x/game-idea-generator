# ðŸŽ® Game Idea Generator

A simple web app that helps generate creative game ideas using AI. This is one of my first React projects as I'm learning web development!

## What it does

-   Fill out a form with your game preferences (genre, platform, budget, etc.)
-   Get AI-generated game concepts with detailed descriptions
-   Export your favorite ideas as PDF documents
-   Clean, responsive design that works on mobile

## Technologies I'm learning

-   **React** with TypeScript
-   **Tailwind CSS** for styling
-   **Vite** for development
-   **Supabase** for database (still figuring this out!)

## How to run it

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

You'll need to create a `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials (copy from `.env` template).

## Current status

-   âœ… Basic form and UI working
-   âœ… Mock game ideas generation
-   âœ… PDF export functionality
-   ðŸ”„ Working on real AI integration
-   ðŸ“‹ Planning to add user accounts

## What I learned

-   How to structure a React project
-   Using TypeScript for better code
-   Responsive design with Tailwind
-   Working with environment variables
-   Basic Git workflow

This project helped me understand how modern web apps work and gave me hands-on experience with popular tools and frameworks.

## Credits
