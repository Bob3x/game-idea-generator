# üéÆ Game Idea Generator

A simple web app that helps generate creative game ideas using AI. This is one of my first React projects with AI integration as I'm practicing my development skills!

## What it does

-   Fill out a form with your game preferences (genre, platform, budget, etc.)
-   Get AI-generated game concepts with detailed descriptions
-   Export your favorite ideas as PDF documents
-   Clean, responsive design that works on mobile

## Technologies I'm learning

-   **React** with TypeScript
-   **Tailwind CSS** for styling
-   **Vite** for development
-   **Supabase** for database (still setting up!)

## How to run it

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

You'll need to create a `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials (copy from `.env` template).

## Current status

-   ‚úÖ Basic form and UI working
-   ‚úÖ Mock game ideas generation
-   ‚úÖ PDF export functionality
-   üîÑ Working on real AI integration
-   üìã Planning to add user accounts

## What I learned

-   How to structure a React project
-   Using TypeScript for better code
-   Responsive design with Tailwind
-   Working with environment variables
-   Basic Git workflow

This project helped me understand how modern web apps work and gave me hands-on experience with popular tools and frameworks.
